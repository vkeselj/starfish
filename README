Text::Starfish version 1.39
===========================
Note: The above lines are generated based on the following code:
<? read_starfish_conf(); &set_readme_line1; !>

The Text::Starfish module and starfish command-line utility support
processing of embedded Perl code in an arbitrary text and provide for
flexible text patterns that identify such code or activate more
general text replacement.

The main Starfish web site is:
http://web.cs.dal.ca/~vlado/srcperl/starfish/starfish.html

Documentation is part of the file Starfish.pm in the Pod format.  To
convert it into the manual page format, use the following commands
('$' is just a shell prompt, do not type it!):

 $ pod2html Starfish.pm

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make
 $ make test
 $ make install

If you do not have permissions to install the module in the
system-wide module repository, you can install it locally; e.g.,

 $ perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/mydir

DEPENDENCIES

No significant dependencies, as far as I know.  All used Perl modules
should be a part of Perl core.  Let me know if you find something
important to add.
