Testing Hook adding:

#<?starfish
# $Star->addHook("\n#sd!/", qr{/(?=\n)},  '$_ = "\\nwhile (/$_/g)  { and so on \\"d\\$1\\";}"');
# $Star->addHook("\n#sdi!/",qr{/i(?=\n)}, '$_ = "\\nwhile (/$_/ig) { and so on \\"d\\$1\\";}"');
# $Star->addHook("\n#s!/",  qr{/(?=\n)},  '$_ = "\\nwhile (/$_/g)  { and so on \\"d\\$1\\";}"');
#
# # This one did not get a proper priority:
# $Star->addHook("\n#sd!/",qr{/i(?=\n)}, '$_ = "\\nwhile (/$_/ig)  { NEW \\"d\\$1\\";}"');
